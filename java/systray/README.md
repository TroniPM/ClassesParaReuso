# Message queue at system tray - JAVA!

When you need to send multiple simultaneous messages to systray, they are all displayed "at the same time", so you can not view the notifications. A message queue then is required to show all messages displayed for at least a set amount of time before the others messages. These 3 classes do the job **Main**, **Mensagem**, **MensagemWatcher**.
